**Introduction to the Data**:  
The associated data set is from Kickstarter.com.  Kickstarter.com is a website where people can campaign for crowd funding from the internet  to support their project. Funds for the campaigns are provided at the descretion of the crowd. Investigate how the *free text titles* of campaigns might influence the campaign success in raising requested funds. This high level data contains descriptive information of 2016 and 2017 kickstarter campaigns. The descriptive data contains dates, dollars raised, name of campaign as free text, factor variables, and if the campaign was successful in receiving funding (the “state” variable in the data). 

**Case**: 
Build an algorithm that can predict if a campaign will be successful in receiving full funding. *This case study is within the feature engineering stage, and a fully vetted algorithm is not needed for completion.*

**Task**: 
The campaign titles (“name” variable in the data) that people use when creating their campaign have many formats. To extract the maximum information from these text titles, create 3 features from the titles.

**Deliverables**:  
1. Code from analysis 
2. Powerpoint presentation of case study findings
